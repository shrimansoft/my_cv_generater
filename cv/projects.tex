  \cvpub{\textbf{Exceptional point : } Under the guidance of Dr. Kush Saha in
    Spring of 2021 }

  \textbf{Abstract : } We studied the mathematical formulation of exceptional
  points in a general $2 \times 2$ non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that is a function
  of a complex parameter.

  \cvpub{\textbf{Dynamics of Newton's and Halley's Method :}
    Under the guidance of
    Dr Ritwik Mukherjee, Dr Sayantani Bhattacharyya in Fall of 2022 }

  \textbf{Abstract : }
  We studied the Basins of convergence by Newton's and Halleyâ€™s Methods on the complex quadratic polynomial.
  We found that the iteration converges to the root closer to the initial choice in both methods.

  \cvpub{\textbf{Convergence analysis of Newton's and Secant
      methods and their generalisations :}
    Under the guidance of
    Dr Ritwik Mukherjee, Dr Sayantani Bhattacharyya in Spring of 2023 }

  \textbf{Abstract : }
  We show that the order of convergence of the secant method is the golden
  ratio(This is not new work). We introduced a Variant of Newton's method where instead of
  fitting the straight line, we fit the parabola. We analysed its convergence and its order
  of convergence.
